Disconnect-ExchangeOnline -Confirm:\$false

# Reconnect
Connect-ExchangeOnline
\`\`\`

#### Connection Issues - On-Premises
\`\`\`powershell
# Verify WinRM configuration
winrm quickconfig

# Test connectivity
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName "exchange01.contoso.com" -Port 80
\`\`\`

#### Permission Issues

- **Certificate-Based Authentication**: For unattended execution
- **Credential Objects**: For scripted scenarios

### Data Protection
- Reports may contain sensitive configuration data
- Store reports in secure locations
- Consider encryption for sensitive environments
- Review reports before sharing

### Network Security

\$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Monthly -At "02:00AM" -DaysOfMonth 1
\$settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -AllowStartIfOnBatteries -DontStopIfGoingOnBatteries
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "Exchange Documentation" -Action \$action -Trigger \$trigger -Settings \$settings
\`\`\`
